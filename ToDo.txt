On program startup populate database tables with mock data. Add 10-100 records per table.

On program startup fire "Login form"
It will display "username" and "password" fields along with "Login" button.
Bellow it there will be "Register button" which leads to Register form. Implement logic for registration

Once successfully logged in move user to MainForm and hide Login form.
Main form will show dashboard with some info and button to Manage Products > lead to new form
Information displayed in dashboard is:
 - Number of products in database
 - Number of Cars
 - Number of Trucks
 - Number of Bikes
 - Total worth of stock in $

Inside managing products display dataGridView with all products listed (you will have additional column for product type).
Use different colors for product type groups.
Allow adding/changing/removing new product through datagridview and implement logic for it

Implement validations on everything

Create "Print" button on both dashboard and products managing windows. It will save file on selected destination.
Also create "Send report via mail" on both places to send report to the mail (for this one create custom "InputBox(string title, string text,
out string returnValue)", to work same as MessageBox.Show) to input email

Deploy application using ClickOnce

Make all buttons and textboxes bactrounds change colors like rainbow all the time, slowly.

Once product is created/deleted inside "Manage products" window, immediatelly update dashboard information
